# macOS arm64 PGSO candidate pipeline

This directory owns the non-publishing Stage 1 build for a smaller macOS arm64 `fx` candidate. It preserves Zig ReleaseSafe semantics and the complete product feature set, then uses native LLVM profiles to keep measured hot code speed-oriented and compile profile-proven cold functions for size.

The candidate is accepted only when it is no larger than **7.800 MiB**, has the preferred **0.250 MiB** of size headroom, passes the deterministic product corpus, and stays within a **10%** p50 and p95 performance regression limit. The ordinary ReleaseSafe binary remains the control and recovery path.

## Toolchain and target

The driver requires:

- macOS on an arm64 host
- generic `aarch64-macos` output
- Zig `0.16.0`
- LLVM `21.1.8` tools and profile runtime from one configured LLVM root
- the selected Xcode macOS SDK and native Apple linker with arm64 support
- Hyperfine `1.20.0`
- the selected source commit, update channel, bitcode hash, corpus hash, and profile-generation flags

The pipeline does not use the host CPU as the release target. The final candidate must match the control's architecture, minimum macOS version, SDK compatibility stamp, main-stack request, and dynamic-library dependency versions. It must contain a valid code signature, contain no profile sections or profile-runtime dependency, and produce no profile output when executed.

Training records execution counts and first-use function timestamps in the same
continuous profiles. The main PGSO executable uses LLVM's temporal function
order through the native Apple linker. Identical-code folding stays disabled. The function-starts table is
omitted, matching the existing stripped Zig link. The exact optimized Zig
runtime object and bundled system-library stub remain the link inputs; the
selected Xcode SDK supplies re-export stubs. Compatibility and sysroot SDK
versions are recorded separately. Build evidence retains input digests, every
mapped or unmapped profile name, the full linker map, and verified ordered code
counts. Empty or ambiguous mappings, an unapplied order, and truncated symbol
output fail closed.

## Commands

Every mutating command requires a fresh or empty output directory. State from separate runs is never merged implicitly.

```bash
brew install llvm@21

python3 -m scripts.pgso build \
  --llvm-bin "$(brew --prefix llvm@21)/bin" \
  --output-dir /tmp/fx-pgso-build

python3 -m scripts.pgso train \
  --llvm-bin "$(brew --prefix llvm@21)/bin" \
  --output-dir /tmp/fx-pgso-train

python3 -m scripts.pgso all \
  --llvm-bin "$(brew --prefix llvm@21)/bin" \
  --output-dir /tmp/fx-pgso-candidate \
  --target aarch64-macos \
  --update-channel stable \
  --samples 50
```

`build` verifies the control, bitcode, instrumented link, profile-section alignment, signature, and one profile-producing smoke. `train` additionally runs the versioned corpus and creates a checked candidate. Both are useful diagnostics but finish with `eligible: false` because they do not run the complete release-safety gate.

`all` runs the complete fresh-build path: training, profile use, candidate verification, the candidate behavior corpus, and the startup comparisons. It is the canonical CI entry point. `report --output-dir <path>` is the only command that may reuse an existing directory, and it only reads a complete eligible manifest.

The production workflow runs the same gate as a distributed DAG. One seed job
builds the control, bitcode, and instrumented binary. Up to twenty training
jobs execute non-overlapping corpus assignments, one coordinator validates and
merges every shard profile and builds the candidate. Up to twenty behavior jobs
then verify non-overlapping candidate assignments. The startup comparisons run
on a fresh machine for each command. Every performance job measures its
immutable control and candidate on the same machine.

The fx candidate applies the accepted whole-program profile-use pipeline, then
uses LLVM's deterministic name-hash split to divide the optimized IR into two
balanced modules. Each module is outlined sequentially before the modules are
relinked and their original private linkage is restored. This keeps the IR
outliner's suffix-tree memory below the standard runner limit without changing
the training corpus or performance measurement hardware.
Generated IR helpers are kept in one dense linker cluster ordered by their
hottest profiled caller so outlining does not scatter startup code across cold
pages.

`python3 -m scripts.pgso.distributed plan` emits deterministic, non-empty
GitHub Actions matrices. The remaining distributed subcommands are workflow
phase interfaces: `train-shard`, `candidate`, `behavior-shard`, `measure`, and
`aggregate`. They reject a source, corpus, toolchain, bitcode, instrumented
binary, candidate, assignment, or shard identity mismatch. The aggregate
command requires all 36 training scenarios, all 53 behavior scenarios, and
every startup performance gate exactly once before it emits `eligible: true`.

Workflow artifact names include the producing run attempt, so earlier attempts
remain available. Seed and candidate consumers use the artifact IDs returned
by their producer jobs. Shard collection selects the newest attempt for each
shard; a failed or invalid newest result cannot fall back to an earlier pass.
Source and artifact hashes must still match before aggregation can qualify a
release. Overwrite applies only to an identical attempt-qualified name.

## Corpus

[`corpus.json`](corpus.json) lists CLI invocations rather than test files. Training
holds five direct commands, `help`, `--version`, `status --json`, `doctor --json`,
and `sessions --json`. A bounded `profile_runs` count weights a direct training
command without duplicating manifest entries or final behavior checks.

Every scenario must be classified as training, verification-only, or intentionally
excluded. The corpus loader fails on missing, duplicate, stale, or unclassified
scenarios, so new coverage cannot silently bypass release qualification.

Corpus processes receive per-scenario homes and isolated tmux sockets and cannot
inherit model credentials, the caller's tmux session, an external LLVM profile
destination, or caller-selected fx tracing. The CLI suite explicitly links the
host Keychains directory into only its scenario home so its uniquely named fake
macOS Keychain assertions can run; no other scenario receives that access.

Each training scenario must create a new nonempty raw profile. The driver merges that batch into the accumulator atomically, deletes only the successfully merged raw files, and stops before profile use on any missing scenario, timeout, warning, merge failure, or cleanup failure.

Tmux-backed E2E scenarios receive one bounded file-level retry, matching Full
CI. Before that retry, the driver removes the failed scenario HOME, isolated
tmux directory, debug trace, and every raw profile created by the failed
attempt. A second failure remains terminal. Direct commands and non-tmux E2E
scenarios are never retried.

Candidate behavior qualification records each scenario's debug trace under `candidate-behavior/traces/` without restricting its trace scopes. A failed tmux case therefore preserves its internal startup subtype and cleanup evidence instead of retaining only the public protocol error, while tests that select their own trace path or scopes keep their intended behavior.

## Qualification policy

Startup compares `help`, `--version`, `status --json`, `doctor --json`, and `sessions --json`. It first executes each verified immutable artifact once to require successful output and empty stderr. Timing then uses pinned Hyperfine with no intermediate shell, ten warmups per artifact in each of at least 100 alternating rounds, and at least 1,000 measured samples per artifact. No contiguous block exceeds ten measured runs, so short machine-noise bursts are distributed between control and candidate while p95 retains 50 tail observations. Startup measurement sets `FX_DISABLE_KEYCHAIN=1` so the compiler comparison cannot be dominated by host-global macOS Keychain subprocess latency; the deterministic behavior corpus remains responsible for exercising Keychain integration. No per-sample Python process management or evidence-file write is included in the timed boundary, and measurement never replaces `zig-out/bin/fx`.

A candidate fails a startup comparison when either p50 or p95 is more than 10% slower than its matching control. Command failures and timeouts fail qualification and are never replaced. The existing Linux startup workflow remains the authority for the repository's absolute 2 ms command budget.

## Output and failure behavior

The output root contains:

```text
control/bin/fx
instrumented/fx
candidate/fx
profiles/merged.profdata
candidate-behavior/traces/
logs/
measurements/
manifest.json
```

Generated binaries, bitcode, objects, profiles, caches, measurements, and logs are evidence artifacts and must not be committed. `manifest.json` is rewritten atomically after every stage. A failed manifest retains completed evidence, names the failing stage, records `eligible: false`, and never falls back to an unprofiled candidate.

The driver also streams operational progress to the invoking terminal or GitHub Actions log. Every stage announces its start and terminal status with elapsed time, every child command announces its start and terminal status, and child stdout and stderr remain visible while the process runs. A silent child emits a heartbeat every 30 seconds. JSON evidence normally retains at most the last 1,048,576 characters from each output stream per command. The candidate symbol census permits 8,388,608 characters and rejects truncated output. Records include total character counts and truncation status; no environment variables are printed.

Corpus scenarios inherit only a small operating-system environment allowlist. Credentials, live-test flags, tracing settings, and repository dotenv files are excluded unless a value is explicitly declared in the versioned corpus. The runner temporarily installs the assigned artifact at `zig-out/bin/fx` for E2E compatibility, then restores the prior file (or prior absence) after success, failure, timeout, or cancellation.

The native workflow uploads bounded phase evidence rather than caches or
intermediate compiler objects. Pull requests and manual runs have read-only
repository permissions and do not change release, dev-channel, CDN, tag, or
GitHub Release state. The stable release workflow may call the same gate with
release packaging enabled; only the candidate copied by the successful final
aggregate is packaged as `fx-macos-aarch64.tar.gz`.
